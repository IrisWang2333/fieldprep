TREATMENT VARIATION ANALYSIS - SUMMARY REPORT
======================================================================

QUESTION:
Among eligible bundles (with potholes in preceding week), do we have
both FIXED and UNFIXED segments each week to ensure treatment variation?

GOAL:
Avoid weeks where treatment is all 0 (all unfixed) or all 1 (all fixed),
which would eliminate treatment variation.

DATA:
- Historical period: 2021-2025
- Total weeks analyzed: 261
- Weeks with potholes in eligible bundles: 259

RESULTS:

1. SEGMENT COUNTS (Mean per week):
   - Segments with potholes: 8.2
   - Segments fixed (R_it=1): 2.9
   - Segments unfixed (R_it=0): 5.3

2. PROPORTION (Among segments with potholes):
   - Mean % fixed: 38.4%
   - Mean % unfixed: 61.6%
   - Median % fixed: 33.3%
   - Std % fixed: 29.2%

3. TREATMENT VARIATION:
   - Weeks with BOTH fixed and unfixed: 192/261 (73.6%)
   - Weeks WITHOUT variation: 69/261 (26.4%)

4. ISSUE BREAKDOWN:
   - good_variation      : 192 weeks ( 73.6%)
   - all_unfixed         :  50 weeks ( 19.2%)
   - all_fixed           :  17 weeks (  6.5%)
   - no_potholes         :   2 weeks (  0.8%)

5. BALANCE ANALYSIS (Among weeks with potholes):
   - 10-90% split: 189/259 ( 73.0%)
   - 20-80% split: 162/259 ( 62.5%)
   - 30-70% split: 114/259 ( 44.0%)
   - 40-60% split:  63/259 ( 24.3%)

CONCLUSION: ⚠ LIMITED VARIATION

73.6% of weeks have both fixed and unfixed segments.
Mean fix rate is 38.4%, indicating substantial treatment variation.

⚠ Some weeks lack treatment variation - may need to adjust design.
