D2DS FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
======================================================================

1. BUNDLE ELIGIBILITY (Conditional on Preceding Week Potholes)
   - Mean eligible bundles per week: 50.7
   - Mean eligible DH bundles: 17.9
   - Mean eligible non-DH bundles: 32.8
   - Weeks with <4 DH bundles: 1 / 261 (0.4%)
   - Weeks with <6 total bundles: 1 / 261 (0.4%)

   CONCLUSION: FEASIBLE
   ✓ Sufficient eligible bundles in most weeks

2. UNFIXED SEGMENTS AVAILABILITY
   - Mean unfixed segments per bundle-week: 0.73
   - Median unfixed segments: 1.0
   - Bundle-weeks with ≥1 unfixed: 9045 (68.1%)

   CONCLUSION: LIMITED
   ⚠ Limited unfixed segments

3. D2DS SEGMENTS FIX TIMING (Historical)
   - Fixed before Saturday: 0 (0.0%)
   - Mean days to fix: 11.7 days

   CONCLUSION: LOW CONTAMINATION
   ✓ Most fixes occur after survey week starts

4. HISTORICAL D2DS SEGMENTS EXPOSURE
   - Pothole rate: 1.19%
   - Fix rate (among potholes): 34.20%
   - Had pothole in preceding week: 1.19%
   - Fixed in preceding week (among those with pothole): 34.27%

OVERALL FEASIBILITY: NEEDS ADJUSTMENT ⚠
