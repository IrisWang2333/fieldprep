D2DS FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
======================================================================

1. BUNDLE ELIGIBILITY (Conditional on Preceding Week Potholes)
   - Mean eligible bundles per week: 39.2
   - Mean eligible DH bundles: 13.8
   - Mean eligible non-DH bundles: 25.4
   - Weeks with <4 DH bundles: 3 / 261 (1.1%)
   - Weeks with <6 total bundles: 1 / 261 (0.4%)

   CONCLUSION: FEASIBLE
   ✓ Sufficient eligible bundles in most weeks

2. UNFIXED SEGMENTS AVAILABILITY
   - Mean unfixed segments per bundle-week: 0.73
   - Median unfixed segments: 1.0
   - Bundle-weeks with ≥1 unfixed: 7032 (68.7%)

   CONCLUSION: LIMITED
   ⚠ Limited unfixed segments

3. D2DS SEGMENTS FIX TIMING (Historical)
   Timeline: Pothole Week N-1 → DH Week N → D2DS Survey Week N+1 (2 weeks after pothole)
   - Fixed before D2DS survey Saturday: 819 (70.4%)
   - Mean days to fix: 12.7 days

   CONCLUSION: HIGH CONTAMINATION
   ⚠ Many potholes fixed before D2DS survey (contamination risk)

4. HISTORICAL D2DS SEGMENTS EXPOSURE
   - Pothole rate: 1.08%
   - Fix rate (among potholes): 33.94%
   - Had pothole in preceding week: 1.08%
   - Fixed in preceding week (among those with pothole): 33.88%

OVERALL FEASIBILITY: NEEDS ADJUSTMENT ⚠
