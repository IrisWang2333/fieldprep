BUNDLE ELIGIBILITY ANALYSIS - SUMMARY REPORT
======================================================================

QUESTION:
Conditional on at least one segment having at least one reported pothole
in the preceding week, can we have enough bundles in a week?

DATA:
- Historical period: 2021-2025
- Total weeks analyzed: 261
- Total bundles in pool: 1,627

RESULTS:
Eligible bundles per week (with pothole in preceding week):
  Mean:   50.7 bundles
  Median: 45.0 bundles
  Range:  [3, 158] bundles
  Std:    21.8 bundles

Percentage of total pool:
  Mean: 3.12%
  This means approximately 3.1% of bundles are "active"
  (had pothole in preceding week) in any given week.

Sufficiency Analysis (weeks meeting threshold):
  ≥ 6 bundles: 260/261 weeks ( 99.6%)
  ≥10 bundles: 260/261 weeks ( 99.6%)
  ≥20 bundles: 260/261 weeks ( 99.6%)
  ≥30 bundles: 244/261 weeks ( 93.5%)
  ≥50 bundles:  97/261 weeks ( 37.2%)

CONCLUSION:
✓ SUFFICIENT
On average, 50.7 bundles per week are eligible
(had pothole in preceding week).

✓ 99.6% of weeks have ≥6 eligible bundles
✓ 99.6% of weeks have ≥10 eligible bundles
✓ 99.6% of weeks have ≥20 eligible bundles
